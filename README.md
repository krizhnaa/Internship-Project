>> Terminal Style Typing Test

    >> Project Idea: "Terminal Typing Test"

        Description:
        Create a terminal-style typing test application that simulates typing in a command-line interface. The application will provide random code snippets or sentences for users to type accurately and measure their typing speed and accuracy.

        Features:

        Terminal Interface: Design a user interface that resembles a command-line terminal, including a command prompt and text area for typing.
        Random Code Snippets: Generate random code snippets or sentences for users to type. You can use an array of predefined code snippets or fetch random quotes or code snippets from an API.
        Typing Speed Measurement: Calculate the typing speed in words per minute (WPM) or characters per minute (CPM) and display it to the user.
        Accuracy Calculation: Evaluate the accuracy of the typed text by comparing it to the original code snippet and display the accuracy percentage.
        Time Limit: Set a time limit for each typing test session and display the remaining time to the user.
    

        Use HTML and CSS to create the terminal-style interface, including the command prompt, text area, and result display.
        Utilize JavaScript to generate random code snippets, measure typing speed and accuracy, and handle user interactions.
        Implement a timer using JavaScript to set the time limit for each typing test session.
        Store.
        Enhance the interface with CSS to give it a realistic terminal look and feel, including appropriate fonts, colors, and animations.
